# Dog Clicker Premium

## Introduction
Dog clicker Premium has been coded from strach (code was a mess, spagethi code). After that we rebuilt the code after learning about organzing a JavaScript code (model, octopus and view) at lesson Web Applications for Udacity nanodegree Front-End Web Developer.

## Instructions
- Open [Project page](https://flanzana.github.io/dog-clicker/) directly in your browser (Google Chrome is recommended) or download the repo and open the file [index.html](index.html) in your browser.
- Select one of 5 dogs from the menu. Dog's image will display in the middle of page.
- For each click on dog's image, click will be counted.
