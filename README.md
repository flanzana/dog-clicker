# Dog Clicker Premium

## Introduction
Dog clicker has been coded from strach (code was a mess) by me. After lesson of organizing a JavaScript code (Model, Octopus and View) we rebuilt the spaghetti code into Dog clicker Premium.

## Instructions
- Open [Project page](https://flanzana.github.io/dog-clicker/) directly in your browser (Google Chrome is recommended) or download the repo and open the file [index.html](index.html) in your browser.
- Select one of 5 dogs from the list. Dog's image will display in the middle of the page.
- For each click on dog's image, click will be counted and displayed on the page.
